Hi, I'm Antti.

I'm a software engineer. At my day job, I build web apps with Typescript (ReactJS and Node). In my free time, I'm working on a project in educational technology. [Argument Studio](http://argumentstudio.com) is a web app for highlighting selected passages in PDF text files and then diagramming those passages on a virtual canvas. It's designed to be a tool for students and teachers that is dead simple to use and works across platforms.
